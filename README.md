# dyno tests for OZI actions

ğŸš§ Work in Progress ğŸš§

Roughly the plan:
1. ğŸ”§ use OZI to re-render a whole dummy project on every push to the default branch
2. ğŸ”¨ trigger ozi.yml workflow on release branches corresponding to the current OZI release ``major.minor`` version
3. ğŸ“¦ publish dyno to TestPyPI
